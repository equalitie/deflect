# Deflect
## Purpose
[Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Distributed_attack "Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)") has become a cheap and common way to shut down legitimate voices. Deflect tries to tilt the balance back in favour of freedom of expression.

This repository contains Ansible playbooks to setup and maintain your own DDoS mitigation infrastructure. Its implementation is based on the Deflect service run by eQualit.ie, which protects hundreds of civil society web sites and has thwarted numerous attacks.

Deflect aims at making it easier to set up an infrastructure capable to absorb large volumes of HTTP traffic without having to subscribe to expensive commercial services or buy specialised infrastructure. It also allows you to keep control of your data and therefore respect visitors' privacy.

## Who is it for?
Civil society organisations wanting to defend their and their partners' web sites at reasonable cost, with trustworthy software and while safeguarding privacy. Many organisations have emphasised the importance not to sacrifice privacy for DDoS protection. By running your own Deflect, there will be no third-party middleman to your web traffic.

Deflect integrates a user-friendly web-based dashboard for both users and system administrators. It therefore makes it easier to set up a commercial, user-oriented DDoS protection service.
